Introduction
==============

Vxkblog is clone of blog app within flother django site. I have found this
app simple, nice, easy so I decided to use it. I have removed dependencies on
other flother apps and used another app for wisiwig editing - django-ckeditor.
I also added i18n and tryed to make all as modular and easy as possible to
make easily pluggable blog app for django.

Installation
==============

1. Clone the read-only repo

     git clone git://github.com/vencax/django-vxk-blog.git

2. Install the dependencies via PIP.  (If you use virtualenv you'll want to
   create a virtual environment and activate it first.)

     pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Add vxkblog into your INSTALLED_APPS as well as other dependant apps.

4. Include vxkblog.urls into your root url conf.

     url(r'^blogz/', include('vxkblog.urls')),
     
5. (OPTIONAL) staticgenerator.
     
If you want your blogs to be chached is static files fo speedup
of thier serving, you have to install staticgenerator and put:

		'staticgenerator.middleware.StaticGeneratorMiddleware',
		
among your MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES.
     
6. You are done


Management commands
=====================

There are three management commands in the project; each one is summarised
below.  For more information read through the code as it's fairly well
commented.

django-admin.py publishnewentries

    Because the site can be heavily cached (if you use the Static
    Generator-created content you can serve the blog static HTML files), any
    entry published in the future will only actually appear once the cache is
    flushed, not once its publishing date has passed.  To ensure the entry
    appears as expected, this command will check for entries whose
    ``published_at`` field is within the last hour.  If there are any, the cache
    will be cleared.

    This command should be run as an hourly cron job.

django-admin.py import_from_flickr

    Imports public photos from a Flickr account (based on settings.FLICKR_NSID)
    and stores them and their metadata in the database.

    This command should be run as regularly if you want to download your photos
    from Flickr.
